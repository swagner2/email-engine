## How to Use These Modules

### Step 1: Identify Your Vertical

Choose the module that best matches your product category. If you sell products across multiple categories (e.g., both supplements and beauty products), you may want to use insights from multiple modules.

### Step 2: Review the Strategy Document

Each module includes a main strategy document (e.g., `SUBMODULE_Apparel-Strategy.md`) that outlines the core concepts, key email flows, segmentation strategies, and campaign ideas specific to that vertical.

### Step 3: Customize the Templates

Some modules include vertical-specific templates (e.g., customer avatars, email flows) that you can customize for your brand. Use these as starting points and adapt them to your unique value proposition.

### Step 4: Integrate with the Core Framework

These modules are designed to work *with* the core framework, not replace it. Use the core framework for foundational elements like brand research, style guides, and general email best practices. Then, layer in the vertical-specific strategies from these modules.

## 1. Core Concepts for Apparel Brands

### 1.1. Visual Storytelling is Everything

Apparel is a highly visual category. Your emails must be aspirational and allow customers to envision themselves wearing your products. Invest in high-quality lifestyle photography, lookbooks, and video content.

### 1.2. Focus on Fit & Sizing

Fit is the #1 concern for online apparel shoppers and the primary driver of returns. Proactively address this in your email marketing by providing detailed size guides, customer reviews that mention fit, and clear return policies.

### 1.3. Drive Repeat Purchases Through Segmentation

Purchase frequency in apparel is lower than in consumable goods. Therefore, a sophisticated segmentation strategy is critical for driving repeat purchases and increasing customer lifetime value.

### 1.4. Leverage Social Proof & Community

Fashion is about identity and belonging. Use user-generated content (UGC), influencer collaborations, and customer spotlights to build a strong brand community.

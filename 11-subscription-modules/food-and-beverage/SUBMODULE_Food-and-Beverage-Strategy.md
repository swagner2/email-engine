# Subscription Module: Food & Beverage

**Vertical:** Food & Beverage (e.g., meal kits, coffee, snacks, wine)

---

## 1. Core Concepts for Food & Beverage

### 1.1. Emphasize Sensory Experience

Your emails must appeal to the senses. Use vivid, descriptive language and high-quality, appetizing imagery to evoke taste, smell, and texture.

*   **Copywriting:** Use words like "crisp," "zesty," "rich," "savory," "aromatic."
*   **Imagery:** Professional, well-lit photos and videos of the food are non-negotiable.

### 1.2. Highlight Convenience & Time-Saving

A primary driver for food subscriptions is convenience. Clearly communicate how your service saves customers time and effort.

*   **Messaging:** "Dinner, solved." "No more grocery store runs." "Healthy meals in minutes."

### 1.3. Build a Routine

The goal is to become a part of the customer's weekly or monthly routine. Your email flows should be designed to reinforce this habit.

*   **Flows:** Replenishment and delivery notification flows are critical.

### 1.4. Leverage Social Proof & Community

Food is inherently social. Use customer reviews, user-generated content (UGC) of people enjoying your food, and community-building initiatives.

*   **Campaigns:** Recipe contests, customer-submitted photos, featured member stories.

## 2. Key Email Flows for Food & Beverage

### 2.1. Subscription Welcome Series

*   **Goal:** To onboard new subscribers, explain how the service works, and build excitement for their first delivery.
*   **Key Emails:**
    *   **Email 1 (Immediate):** Welcome & What to Expect. Confirm their first delivery date and explain the subscription management process.
    *   **Email 2 (Pre-Delivery):** Build the Hype. Showcase the delicious meals or products they are about to receive. Include serving suggestions or recipes.
    *   **Email 3 (Post-Delivery):** How to Get Started. Link to cooking instructions, storage tips, or pairing guides.

### 2.2. Replenishment & Reorder Flow (for non-subscription items)

*   **Goal:** To convert one-time buyers of consumable items (like a bag of coffee) into subscribers.
*   **Strategy:** Trigger a reminder email when they are likely running low, and present the "Subscribe & Save" option as the primary CTA.

### 2.3. Menu/Box Customization Reminder Flow

*   **Goal:** To ensure customers customize their upcoming box, which increases engagement and reduces the likelihood of churn.
*   **Key Emails:**
    *   **Email 1 (7 days before deadline):** "Your next box is ready to customize!"
    *   **Email 2 (24 hours before deadline):** "Last chance to pick your meals!"

### 2.4. Skip/Pause Confirmation Flow

*   **Goal:** To confirm the action and gather feedback on why they are skipping.
*   **Strategy:** Include a one-click survey: "Why did you skip this week?" (e.g., "Traveling," "Have too much food," "Didn't like the options"). This data is invaluable for retention.

### 2.5. Cancellation & Win-back Flow

*   **Goal:** To understand why a customer is canceling and make a final attempt to win them back.
*   **Strategy:** Present a tailored offer based on their cancellation reason (e.g., if they cite "too expensive," offer a discount).

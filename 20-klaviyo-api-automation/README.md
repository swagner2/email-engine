# Klaviyo API & MCP Automation Module

---

## Overview

This module provides the strategic blueprint for automating the execution of your email marketing framework using Klaviyo's APIs and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. By implementing this automation layer, you transform manual, time-intensive tasks into automated workflows that can execute in minutes.

## What's Included

### IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN_Klaviyo-API-and-MCP-Automation.md

A comprehensive implementation plan that details:

-   **The Automation Architecture:** How AI, MCP Server, and Klaviyo APIs work together
-   **Six Automated Workflows:**
    1.  Automated Flow Building
    2.  Automated Segment Building
    3.  Automated Campaign Building (with AI-generated designs)
    4.  Automated Campaign Performance Analysis
    5.  Automated Flow Performance Analysis
    6.  Automated A/B Test Analysis & Recommendations
-   **API Endpoints Required:** Specific Klaviyo API endpoints needed for each workflow
-   **MCP Server Logic:** Step-by-step workflow for how the MCP server orchestrates each task

---

## Key Benefits

**Massive Time Savings:** Reduce flow creation from hours to minutes, campaign building from 2-3 hours to 10-15 minutes, and performance analysis from hours to seconds.

**Elimination of Manual Errors:** API-driven creation ensures segments, flows, and campaigns are built exactly as specified, with no human transcription errors.

**Scalability:** Manage 5-10x more clients with the same team size by automating the execution layer.

**Continuous Improvement:** Automated performance analysis ensures you're always learning from data and making data-driven optimizations.

## How to Use This Module

1.  **Read the Implementation Plan:** Understand the architecture and workflows before beginning development.
2.  **Set Up MCP Server:** Build or configure an MCP server that can make authenticated calls to the Klaviyo API.
3.  **Start with High-Value Automations:** Begin by automating flow and segment building, as these provide the highest ROI.
4.  **Integrate with AI Workflow:** Connect your AI prompts (from the AI Automation Guide) to output structured JSON that the MCP server can consume.
5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Always test automations in a sandbox Klaviyo account before deploying to client accounts.

---

## Prerequisites

-   Access to Klaviyo API (Private API Key for each client account)
-   MCP Server capable of making HTTP requests
-   AI model (e.g., Claude) with ability to output structured JSON
-   Understanding of Klaviyo's data model (segments, flows, campaigns)

---

## Next Steps

After implementing the core automations outlined in this module, consider expanding to:

-   Automated universal block creation and management
-   Automated form creation and optimization
-   Automated SMS flow creation (using Klaviyo SMS APIs)
-   Real-time alerts for performance anomalies

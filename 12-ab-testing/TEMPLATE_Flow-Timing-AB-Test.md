> This template provides a structured approach for A/B testing the timing and duration of your email flows. Use it to plan, execute, and analyze your flow timing tests.

# A/B Test Template: Flow Timing & Duration

---

## 1. Test Details

*   **Test Name:**
*   **Date:**
*   **Flow:**
*   **Primary Goal:** (e.g., Increase conversion rate, reduce unsubscribe rate)

---

## 2. Hypothesis

> "We believe that **[changing the timing/duration to X]** will **[cause Y outcome]** because **[of this reason]**."

**Example:**

> "We believe that *extending our abandoned cart flow from 2 emails to 4 emails over 3 days* will *increase the placed order rate* because *it gives customers more time to consider their purchase and provides more opportunities to address their objections*."

## 3. Variations

### Variation A (Control)

*   **Email 1:** (Time Delay)
*   **Email 2:** (Time Delay)
*   **Email 3:** (Time Delay)

### Variation B (Challenger)

*   **Email 1:** (Time Delay)
*   **Email 2:** (Time Delay)
*   **Email 3:** (Time Delay)
*   **Email 4:** (Time Delay)

---

## 4. Test Setup

*   **Test Split:** (e.g., 50% A, 50% B)
*   **Test Duration:** (e.g., 30 days)
*   **Winning Metric:** (e.g., Placed Order Rate)

---

## 5. Results

| Variation | Placed Order Rate | Unsubscribe Rate | Revenue Per Recipient |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A (Control)** | | | |
| **B (Challenger)** | | | |

*   **Winner:**
*   **Statistical Significance:** (Yes/No)

## 6. Analysis & Learnings

*   **Why did the winning variation perform better?**

*   **What does this tell us about our customers' consideration period?**

*   **How can we apply this learning to other flows?**

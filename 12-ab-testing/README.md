# A/B Testing Module

---

## Overview

A/B testing is the most powerful tool for continuously improving your email marketing performance. This module provides everything you need to build a culture of testing within your agency and for your clients.

Rather than relying on best practices or gut feelings, A/B testing allows you to make data-driven decisions that are specific to each client's unique audience. Small, incremental improvements compound over time to drive significant gains in open rates, click rates, conversion rates, and revenue.

## What's Included in This Module

### 1. **FRAMEWORK_AB-Testing-Methodology.md**

This is the foundation of the module. It outlines a five-step methodology for planning, executing, and analyzing A/B tests:

1.  **Hypothesize:** Formulate a clear, testable hypothesis.
2.  **Prioritize:** Use the PIE framework to decide which tests to run.
3.  **Execute:** Set up and run the test according to best practices.
4.  **Analyze:** Determine the winner and understand the "why."
5.  **Implement & Iterate:** Roll out the winner and plan your next test.

The framework also covers advanced strategies like holdout groups and sequential testing.

### 2. **Test Templates**

We've created ready-to-use templates for the most common types of A/B tests. Each template provides a structured format for planning, executing, and analyzing a specific type of test.

*   **TEMPLATE_Subject-Line-AB-Test.md:** For testing different subject lines.
*   **TEMPLATE_CTA-AB-Test.md:** For testing different calls to action.
*   **TEMPLATE_Flow-Timing-AB-Test.md:** For testing the timing and duration of email flows.
*   **TEMPLATE_Image-AB-Test.md:** For testing different images in your emails.

---

### 3. **TEMPLATE_AB-Test-Log-and-Calendar.md**

This is your central knowledge base for all testing activities. It includes:

*   **A/B Testing Calendar:** Plan your tests in advance on a quarterly basis.
*   **A/B Test Log:** Document the results and learnings from every test you run.

By maintaining this log, you create a searchable database of insights that can inform future marketing decisions and prevent you from re-testing things you've already learned.

### 4. **LIBRARY_AB-Test-Ideas.md**

This comprehensive library contains over 100 A/B test ideas organized by category:

*   Subject Lines
*   Preview Text
*   Sender Name
*   Calls to Action
*   Email Layout & Design
*   Images

### 5. Applying the PIE Framework in Klaviyo

**File:** `GUIDE_Applying-the-PIE-Framework-in-Klaviyo.md`

A detailed, practical guide on how to use the PIE (Potential, Importance, Ease) Framework to prioritize your A/B test ideas specifically within the Klaviyo environment. It includes scoring criteria, real-world examples, and a decision-making template to ensure you are always working on the highest-impact tests.

## How to Use This Module

### For a New Client

1.  **Start with the Framework:** Read through `FRAMEWORK_AB-Testing-Methodology.md` to understand the philosophy and methodology.
2.  **Prioritize Your First Tests:** Use the PIE framework to identify the highest-impact tests to run first. Typically, you'll want to start with high-traffic flows like Welcome Series, Abandoned Cart, and Post-Purchase.
3.  **Plan Your Quarter:** Use the `TEMPLATE_AB-Test-Log-and-Calendar.md` to plan out your tests for the next 3 months.
4.  **Run Your First Test:** Choose a template from the module, fill it out, and execute the test in Klaviyo.
5.  **Document & Iterate:** Log your results in the A/B Test Log and use the learnings to inform your next test.

### For an Existing Client

If you're already running A/B tests for a client, use this module to:

*   **Standardize Your Process:** Adopt the five-step methodology to ensure consistency across all tests.
*   **Expand Your Testing:** Use the `LIBRARY_AB-Test-Ideas.md` to identify new areas to test that you may not have considered before.
*   **Build a Knowledge Base:** Start using the `TEMPLATE_AB-Test-Log-and-Calendar.md` to document all past and future tests.

## Best Practices for A/B Testing

*   **Test One Variable at a Time:** This is the golden rule. Testing multiple variables simultaneously makes it impossible to attribute results.
*   **Ensure Statistical Significance:** Don't call a winner too early. Wait for a large enough sample size and a high win probability (90%+).
*   **Prioritize High-Impact Tests:** Focus on the emails and flows that are sent most frequently and have the biggest impact on revenue.
*   **Document Everything:** Your A/B Test Log is your most valuable asset. It captures institutional knowledge that can be used to onboard new team members and inform future strategy.
*   **Build a Culture of Testing:** Make A/B testing a regular part of your workflow, not a one-off activity.

---

## Key Metrics to Track

*   **Open Rate:** For subject line, sender name, and preview text tests.
*   **Click Rate:** For CTA, layout, image, and copy tests.
*   **Placed Order Rate:** For flow timing, offer, and segmentation tests.
*   **Revenue Per Recipient:** The ultimate metric for understanding the business impact of your tests.

## Conclusion

A/B testing is not a one-time project; it's an ongoing process of continuous improvement. By systematically testing, learning, and iterating, you can drive significant, compounding gains in email marketing performance for your clients.

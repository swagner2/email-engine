## Core Subscription Models for Ecommerce

### 1. The Replenishment Model
**Best For:** Consumable goods (toiletries, food, supplements, coffee)

**Strategy:** Uses buyer data to calculate when customers are running out of products and triggers reminder emails. Can be one-time reminders or recurring offers.

**Example:** Dermalogica uses Klaviyo data to determine likely repurchase intervals. Balance Me achieved an 83% increase in repeat purchases using this model.

### 2. The Curated Subscription Box
**Best For:** Brands with diverse product ranges

**Strategy:** Comprised of several products that give customers a chance to explore different items each month. Can be themed or generic.

**Example:** Bird & Blend sends subscribers three new tea blends monthly.

### 3. The Personalized Subscription Box
**Best For:** Brands that can tailor to individual preferences

**Strategy:** Boxes tailored to customer's unique interests or needs based on quiz data or purchase history.

**Examples:** Stitch Fix (style quiz), BirchBox (beauty preferences)

### 4. The Subscribe and Save Model
**Best For:** Single-product or limited SKU brands

**Strategy:** Customers get discounted rates (typically 10-20% off) for subscribing vs. one-time purchases.

**Example:** Kiehl's offers 10% discount + free shipping for subscribers.

### 5. The Access Subscription
**Best For:** Premium or exclusive product lines

**Strategy:** Customers pay recurring fee to unlock access to products or deals not available to general public. Creates exclusive membership feeling.

**Example:** Beauty Pie - monthly fee for access to changing menu of premium products.

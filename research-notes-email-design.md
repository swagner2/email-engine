## Email Design Best Practices (from Klaviyo Blog)

### 1. Master Template Strategy

- Keep a master email template for consistency
- Maintain several master templates (one for each email type)
- Ensure same font and size for headers, subheaders, and text across all emails
- Focus on subject lines and preview text early in planning

### 2. Accessibility

- Write succinct subject lines and preview text
- Add alt text to all images
- Leave important information out of images
- Use contrasting colors
- Use large headers to separate ideas
- Use descriptive language in links

### 3. Header Design

- Keep headers simple and streamlined
- Include logo and eyebrow copy (only if it enhances headline)
- Don't let header distract from main message

### 4. CTA Strategy

**Keep CTAs Simple:**
- Don't include too many offers or CTAs
- Keep offers relevant and aligned (season, subject line, headlines)
- Use color choice for CTA hierarchy
- Use clean design with line breaks and few impactful images

**CTA Above the Fold:**
- Ensure subscribers don't need to scroll to take action
- Beautiful images are important, but so is the action vehicle

**Low-Commitment CTAs:**
- Use "Learn More" instead of always "Buy Now" or "Shop Now"
- Helps customers get through mental blocks
- Some people just want to learn, experience, or see more

**Live Text and Buttons:**
- Use live text/buttons instead of text on images
- Easier to A/B test and change
- Don't need to go back to design team for small changes

### 5. Mobile-First Design

- People are opening emails on mobile devices
- Ensure emails are responsive (adjust to screen size/orientation)
- Subject line and preview text that fits mobile inbox
- Properly sized, mobile-optimized images
- One-column layout

### 6. Balance of Visuals and Text

- Image-heavy emails can be slow to load
- Visuals communicate vibe, copy delivers message
- Need healthy balance between the two
- Don't rely solely on images for important information

### 7. Movement (GIFs)

- Inbox is getting more competitive
- Any type of movement can hold attention longer
- Use GIFs strategically to highlight key information
- Don't make it overwhelming

### 8. Personalization Through Design

- Segment subscribers based on:
  - Products purchased
  - Funnel position (new, browsing, repeat purchaser)
  - Geography
  - Zero-party data from surveys/quizzes/forms
- Use show/hide feature to personalize banners, images, promotions
- Incorporate first names, product recommendations, optimal send times
- Personalize for milestones (birthday, anniversary, holidays)

### 9. Focus on Pain Points

- Solving customer problems should drive design
- Solutions-based design resonates more than just brand personality
- Put customer problems front and center
- Include stats and data to back up claims

### 10. Dark and Light Mode

- Design for both dark and light modes
- Many people keep smartphones in dark mode during daytime
- Klaviyo allows viewing email as specific person would see it
- Ensure seamless experience in both modes

### 11. Behind-the-Scenes Brand Look

- Use design elements to communicate company culture without stating it
- Color schemes and image selections convey brand personality
- Visual storytelling builds trust
- Creates relationship beyond promotional content

### 12. User-Generated Content (UGC)

- Transforms marketing from broadcasting to community conversation
- Customer photos, testimonials, social media posts add authenticity
- Provides social proof that resonates deeply
- Demonstrates you value customer voices

### 13. Be Bold (Strategically)

- Create memorable experiences in crowded inboxes
- Use unexpected color combinations or unconventional layouts
- Must serve a purpose (seasonal promotions, announcements)
- Build on foundation of consistent brand elements
- Test bold variations with segments before broad implementation

### 14. Footer Design

- Include unsubscribe, preferences links, business address, social accounts
- Great place to showcase brand personality
- Can include land acknowledgements, brand voice elements

### 15. A/B Testing

- Beautiful email isn't necessarily effective
- Test design elements:
  - Adding/removing navigation bar
  - Changing fonts
  - Adding/removing product blocks
  - Switching colors
  - Experimenting with CTAs
  - Subject line copy
- Test only one variable at a time
- Track open and click rates
- Use conditional splits in flows

**Benefits:**
- Drives more revenue
- Builds stronger brand reputation
- Improves deliverability
- Increases engagement rates
- Reduces unsubscribe rates

## Four Types of Email Segmentation

### 1. Demographic Segmentation
**Definition:** Groups subscribers by traits like age and gender

**Use Cases:**
- Tailor emails to specific demographics
- Example: Diapers for new parents vs. other paper products for non-parents

### 2. Behavioral Segmentation
**Definition:** Groups subscribers based on actions and interactions with emails, texts, website, and more

**Use Cases:**
- Target most active subscribers (opened emails in past 6 months)
- Target those likely interested in given campaign (frequently click certain product categories)

### 3. Psychographic Segmentation
**Definition:** Groups subscribers based on interests, values, lifestyles, and personalities

**Use Cases:**
- Target based on what people care about, not just who they are
- Example: Eco-friendly products to environmentally conscious subscribers

### 4. Geographic Segmentation
**Definition:** Groups subscribers by location

**Use Cases:**
- Local events and promotions
- Region-relevant information
- Local store sales

## The 13 Segmentation Strategies

### 1. Customer Engagement

**Case Study: Huda Beauty**
- Saw YoY decline in performance
- Overhauled content strategy and cleaned email list
- Now only sends regular campaigns to subscribers engaged within last 120 days
- Reserves full-list blasts for major annual sales only
- **Result:** Double the YoY growth in YTD Klaviyo-attributed revenue

**Key Insight:** Engaged profiles (engaged with at least one email in recent months) are most valuable segment

**Recommended Strategy - Tiered Engagement Track:**
- **70%** of campaigns to engaged profiles
- **20%** to broader audience
- **10%** to whole list

**Quote:** "With simple Klaviyo segmentation, we were able to clean up a lot of the deliverability issues that we had previously. It was a small thing that created a really big lift." - Phuong Ngo, CRM and Loyalty Manager, Huda Beauty

### 2. Newcomers to Your Business

**Profile:** New subscribers who may not be ready to buy but have indicated interest

**Content Strategy:**
- Top product features
- Brand storytelling
- Testimonials
- Customer reviews
- Help them get to know you better

**Example Brand: Keeps (furniture maker)**
- Offers sampling of introduction content
- Mission information
- Flagship products
- Customer reviews
- Free shipping code incentive

---

### 3. Past Purchase History

**Data Points:**
- What they've bought
- How much spent (total or average)
- How often they order

**Strategy:** Deliver tailored offers, promotions, or perks based on all-time and recent purchasing behaviors

**Timing Considerations:**
- Window of opportunity after purchase
- Product-specific timing (setup instructions, consumable replenishment)

**Example Brand: Graza (olive oil)**
- Sends first-time purchasers follow-up email
- Reminder to purchase refill
- Promotes innovative refill bottles

---

### 4. Customer Reviews

**Segmentation:** Customers who have left reviews (positive or negative)

**Positive Review Response:**
- Send note of appreciation
- Share offer to incentivize future reviews and purchases
- **Important:** Offer incentives for all reviews, not just positive ones

**Negative Review Response:**
- Always respond to show you heard feedback
- Opportunity to win them over

**Example Brand: Compass Coffee**
- Uses Klaviyo Reviews to incentivize photo submissions
- Conditional split: Review with photo = 15% discount on next order
- Review without photo = thank-you email + reminder to leave review

---

**Definition:** Total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their relationship with your business

**Use Cases:**
- Identify and reward high-value customers
- Exclusive offers and early access

## 1. The Importance of Mobile Optimization

According to recent studies, over 60% of emails are now opened on a mobile device. If your emails are not optimized for mobile, you are likely providing a poor experience for the majority of your subscribers. This can lead to lower open rates, click-through rates, and conversions.

## 2. Key Principles of Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Design

Use a responsive email template that automatically adjusts to the size of the screen. Klaviyo's templates are responsive by default, so you don't need to worry about coding this yourself.

### Single-Column Layout

A single-column layout is the easiest to read on a small screen. Avoid using multi-column layouts, as they can be difficult to navigate on a mobile device.

### Large Fonts and Buttons

Use a font size of at least 16px for body copy and make your call-to-action buttons at least 44px by 44px. This will ensure that your emails are easy to read and that your CTAs are easy to tap.

### Concise Copy

Mobile users have short attention spans. Keep your copy concise and to the point. Use short sentences and paragraphs, and break up your text with headings and bullet points.

### Optimized Images

Compress your images to reduce their file size and improve loading times. Use a tool like TinyPNG to optimize your images.

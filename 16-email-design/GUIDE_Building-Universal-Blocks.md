## 1. What Are Universal Blocks?

Universal blocks are reusable content blocks that can be saved and used across multiple email templates. When you update a universal block, you have the option to apply the changes to every template where it is used. This makes it easy to maintain brand consistency and update your messaging across all of your emails at once.

## 2. How to Create a Universal Block

1.  **Open an Email Template:** Open any email template in the Klaviyo editor.
2.  **Create Your Block:** Create the content block that you want to save as a universal block. This can be any type of block, including text, image, button, or a combination of blocks within a section.
3.  **Save the Block:** Hover over the block and click the **star icon**.
4.  **Name Your Block:** Give your block a descriptive name that will make it easy to find later (e.g., "Header - Main Nav," "Footer - Standard").
5.  **Click Create:** Your block is now saved as universal content and will be available in the **Universal** tab of the content library.

## 3. Essential Universal Blocks to Create

We recommend creating the following universal blocks as a starting point for your email design system:

### Header

*   **Content:** Your brand's logo and primary navigation links (e.g., "Shop," "New Arrivals," "About Us").
*   **Best Practices:** Keep it simple and clean. Don't overload it with too many links.

### Footer

*   **Content:** Your company's contact information, social media links, unsubscribe link, and manage preferences link.
*   **Best Practices:** Include all legally required information. Use social media icons to save space.

### Value Propositions

*   **Content:** A block that highlights your brand's key value propositions (e.g., "Free Shipping on Orders Over $50," "Free Returns," "100% Satisfaction Guarantee").
*   **Best Practices:** Use icons to make it easy to scan.

### Testimonial

*   **Content:** A block for showcasing a customer review or testimonial.
*   **Best Practices:** Include the customer's name and a star rating if possible.

### Social Feed

*   **Content:** A block that pulls in your latest Instagram or TikTok posts.
*   **Best Practices:** Use a third-party tool like `elfsight` to create a dynamic social feed.

## 5. How to Edit a Universal Block

When you edit a universal block, you have two options:

1.  **Edit Across All Instances:** This will apply your changes to every template where the block is used. This is the recommended option for most edits, as it ensures consistency.
2.  **Unlink and Edit Independently:** This will create a new, independent copy of the block that is not linked to the original universal block. Use this option if you need to make a one-off change to a block for a specific email.

## 6. Best Practices for Managing Universal Blocks

*   **Use a Naming Convention:** Use a consistent naming convention for your universal blocks to make them easy to find (e.g., "Header - Main Nav," "Footer - Standard").
*   **Keep It Organized:** Regularly review your universal blocks and delete any that are no longer needed.
*   **Designate an Owner:** Designate one person or a small team to be responsible for managing your universal blocks. This will prevent the system from becoming cluttered and disorganized.

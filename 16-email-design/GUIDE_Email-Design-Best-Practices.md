## 1. Layout and Hierarchy

### Single-Column Layout

For mobile-first design, a single-column layout is almost always the best choice. It's easy to read on a small screen and ensures that your content is displayed in a logical order.

### Visual Hierarchy

Use a clear visual hierarchy to guide the reader's eye through your email. The most important elements (like your headline and CTA) should be the most prominent.

### White Space

Don't be afraid to use white space. It can help to reduce clutter, improve readability, and create a more professional look.

## 2. Typography

### Font Choice

Stick to a small number of web-safe fonts (like Arial, Helvetica, and Georgia) to ensure that your emails look consistent across all email clients. If you use a custom font, be sure to specify a fallback font.

### Font Size

Use a font size of at least 16px for body copy to ensure that your emails are easy to read on a mobile device.

### Line Height

Use a line height of at least 1.5 to improve readability.

## 3. Color

### Brand Colors

Use your brand's colors to create a consistent look and feel across all of your marketing channels.

### Contrast

Use a high-contrast color scheme to ensure that your text is easy to read. Use a tool like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to test your color combinations.

### CTA Color

Use a bright, contrasting color for your call-to-action buttons to make them stand out.

## 4. Images

### Image-to-Text Ratio

Aim for a healthy balance of images and text. Too many images can make your email slow to load and may trigger spam filters.

### Alt Text

Always include descriptive alt text for your images. This is important for accessibility and will be displayed if the images are blocked by the email client.

### Image Optimization

Compress your images to reduce their file size and improve loading times. Use a tool like TinyPNG to optimize your images.

---

## 5. Accessibility

### Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML tags (like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>`) to structure your content. This will make it easier for screen readers to interpret your emails.

### Descriptive Links

Use descriptive link text that tells the reader where they will be taken when they click the link. Avoid using generic link text like "Click Here."

### Language Attribute

Specify the language of your email in the `<html>` tag (e.g., `<html lang="en">`). This will help screen readers to pronounce your content correctly.

---

## 6. Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Design

Use a responsive email template that automatically adjusts to the size of the screen. Klaviyo's templates are responsive by default.

### Finger-Friendly CTAs

Make your call-to-action buttons large enough to be easily tapped with a finger. A minimum size of 44px by 44px is recommended.

### Test on Mobile

Always test your emails on a mobile device before sending them to your subscribers.

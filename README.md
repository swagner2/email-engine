## Introduction

This system is a structured framework of documents, templates, and workflows designed to help your agency deliver thorough, strategic, and effective email marketing services to direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands using Shopify and Klaviyo.

The goal of this system is to standardize your process, ensure consistency and quality across all clients, and accelerate the onboarding and implementation timeline.

## How to Use This System: A Step-by-Step Guide

For each new client, you will create a copy of this entire framework and work through the documents in a logical order. Here is the recommended workflow:

### Step 1: Client Onboarding

**Folder:** `08-client-onboarding`

1.  **Start with the Checklist:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Client-Onboarding-Checklist.md` as your master guide for the entire onboarding process. It will walk you through every step, from pre-kickoff to go-live.

2.  **Schedule the Kickoff:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Kickoff-Meeting-Agenda.md` to run a structured and productive first meeting with your new client.

### Step 2: Brand & Customer Discovery

**Folder:** `02-brand-research`

1.  **Brand Research:** Have the client fill out the `TEMPLATE_Brand-Research-and-Discovery.md` before the kickoff meeting. This is the foundational document for the entire strategy.

2.  **Define the Voice:** Work with the client to complete the `TEMPLATE_Brand-Voice-and-Tone.md` to establish the brand's personality.

3.  **Set the Style:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Style-Guide.md` to define the visual and written standards for all emails.

### Step 3: Define the Strategy

**Folders:** `03-customer-avatars`, `04-segmentation-strategy`, `07-product-strategy`

1.  **Create Customer Avatars:** Based on the discovery research, create 2-3 detailed customer profiles using the `TEMPLATE_Customer-Avatar.md`.

2.  **Develop Segmentation Strategy:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Segmentation-Strategy.md` to outline how you will segment the client's audience in Klaviyo.

3.  **Map Out Product Messaging:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Product-Features-and-Benefits-Matrix.md` to translate product features into compelling benefits.

4.  **Plan Merchandising:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Merchandising-Strategy.md` to identify opportunities for cross-sells, upsells, and bundles.

### Step 4: Implementation

**Folders:** `05-email-flows`, `06-copywriting-templates`

1.  **Build the Flows:** Use the templates in the `05-email-flows` folder as blueprints for building the core automated flows in Klaviyo. Each template provides the structure, timing, and content for each email in the flow.

2.  **Write the Copy:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Email-Copywriting-Guidelines.md` and the other templates in the `06-copywriting-templates` folder to write on-brand, persuasive copy for all your emails.

### Step 5: Ongoing Management

Once the foundational flows are live, this system will continue to serve as your strategic guide for:

*   **Campaign Planning:** Use the customer avatars and segmentation strategy to plan targeted email campaigns.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Use the defined KPIs to measure the success of your efforts and identify areas for optimization.
*   **Client Reporting:** Use the strategy documents to provide context for your performance reports and demonstrate the value you are providing.

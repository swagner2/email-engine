## How to Use This System: A Step-by-Step Guide

For each new client, you will create a copy of this entire framework and work through the documents in a logical order. Here is the recommended workflow:

### Step 1: Client Onboarding

**Folder:** `08-client-onboarding`

1.  **Start with the Checklist:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Client-Onboarding-Checklist.md` as your master guide for the entire onboarding process. It will walk you through every step, from pre-kickoff to go-live.

2.  **Schedule the Kickoff:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Kickoff-Meeting-Agenda.md` to run a structured and productive first meeting with your new client.

### Step 2: Brand & Customer Discovery

**Folder:** `02-brand-research`

1.  **Brand Research:** Have the client fill out the `TEMPLATE_Brand-Research-and-Discovery.md` before the kickoff meeting. This is the foundational document for the entire strategy.

2.  **Define the Voice:** Work with the client to complete the `TEMPLATE_Brand-Voice-and-Tone.md` to establish the brand's personality.

3.  **Set the Style:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Style-Guide.md` to define the visual and written standards for all emails.

### Step 3: Define the Strategy

**Folders:** `03-customer-avatars`, `04-segmentation-strategy`, `07-product-strategy`

1.  **Create Customer Avatars:** Based on the discovery research, create 2-3 detailed customer profiles using the `TEMPLATE_Customer-Avatar.md`.

2.  **Develop Segmentation Strategy:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Segmentation-Strategy.md` to outline how you will segment the client's audience in Klaviyo.

3.  **Map Out Product Messaging:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Product-Features-and-Benefits-Matrix.md` to translate product features into compelling benefits.

4.  **Plan Merchandising:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Merchandising-Strategy.md` to identify opportunities for cross-sells, upsells, and bundles.

### Step 4: Implementation

**Folders:** `05-email-flows`, `06-copywriting-templates`

1.  **Build the Flows:** Use the templates in the `05-email-flows` folder as blueprints for building the core automated flows in Klaviyo. Each template provides the structure, timing, and content for each email in the flow.

2.  **Write the Copy:** Use the `TEMPLATE_Email-Copywriting-Guidelines.md` and the other templates in the `06-copywriting-templates` folder to write on-brand, persuasive copy for all your emails.

### Step 5: Ongoing Management

Once the foundational flows are live, this system will continue to serve as your strategic guide for:

*   **Campaign Planning:** Use the customer avatars and segmentation strategy to plan targeted email campaigns.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Use the defined KPIs to measure the success of your efforts and identify areas for optimization.
*   **Client Reporting:** Use the strategy documents to provide context for your performance reports and demonstrate the value you are providing.

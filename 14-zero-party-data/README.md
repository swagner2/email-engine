## Overview

In a privacy-first world where third-party cookies are disappearing, zero-party data is the most valuable asset your clients can have. Zero-party data is information that customers willingly and proactively share with a brand. It includes preferences, purchase intentions, personal context, and how they want the brand to recognize them.

This module provides everything you need to build a comprehensive zero-party data strategy for your D2C clients. It covers data collection methods, profile enrichment, advanced segmentation, and personalization tactics that will dramatically improve Klaviyo performance.

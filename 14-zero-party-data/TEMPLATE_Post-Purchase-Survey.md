# Data Collection Template: Post-Purchase Survey

---

## 1. Description

A post-purchase survey is a short survey that is presented to customers immediately after they complete a purchase. It is one of the most effective ways to collect zero-party data because customers are highly engaged at this point in the journey.

## 2. Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High Engagement:** Customers are most likely to respond to a survey immediately after making a purchase. | **Limited Scope:** You can only ask a few questions without disrupting the post-purchase experience. |
| **Rich Insights:** You can learn why customers are buying, who they are buying for, and what their needs are. | **Requires a Survey Tool:** You will likely need a third-party survey tool (e.g., Fairing, Enquire) to create and manage your survey. |
| **Attribution Data:** You can ask customers how they heard about you, which can be more accurate than traditional attribution models. | |

## 4. The Anatomy of a High-Converting Post-Purchase Survey

### The Placement

*   **On the Order Confirmation Page:** This is the most common and effective placement. The survey should appear directly on the page, not as a pop-up.

### The Questions

*   **Keep It Short:** 1-3 questions is ideal. Any more than that and you risk survey fatigue.
*   **Use Multiple Choice:** Multiple choice questions are easier to answer than open-ended questions.
*   **Start with the Most Important Question:** If you can only ask one question, what is the most important thing you want to know?

### The Design

*   **Seamless Integration:** The survey should look and feel like a natural part of your order confirmation page.
*   **Mobile-First:** The survey must be easy to complete on a mobile device.

## 5. Optimization Tips

*   **Rotate Your Questions:** Don't ask the same questions all the time. Rotate your questions to gather a wider range of insights.
*   **Analyze the Data:** Look for trends in the survey responses. Use the insights to inform your marketing, product development, and overall business strategy.
*   **Integrate with Klaviyo:** Ensure your survey tool is integrated with Klaviyo so that all the data is stored as custom properties on the customer's profile.
*   **Act on the Data:** The insights you gather from your post-purchase survey are only valuable if you act on them. Use the data to create more personalized experiences for your customers.
*   **Consider Incentives (with caution):** While you can offer an incentive for completing the survey, it's often not necessary. The best incentive is the promise of a better customer experience.

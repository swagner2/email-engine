## Core Principles

*   **Keep it Short & Punchy:** Aim for 50 characters or less to avoid getting cut off on mobile devices.
*   **Create Curiosity:** Pique the reader's interest without giving everything away.
*   **State the Benefit:** Clearly communicate the value inside the email.
*   **Use Personalization:** Include the customer's name or reference their past behavior.
*   **Use Emojis (Sparingly):** Emojis can help your subject line stand out, but use them in a way that is on-brand.

## The Formulas

### 1. The Question

    *   "Ready for a change?"
    *   "Did you see what's new?"

### 2. The "How-To"

    *   "The secret to [Achieving Goal]"
    *   "Finally, a [Product Category] that works"

### 4. The Urgency/Scarcity

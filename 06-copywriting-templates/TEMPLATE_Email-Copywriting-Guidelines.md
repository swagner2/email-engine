## Section 1: Core Principles

### 1.1. Speak to the Avatar

Before writing a single word, always have the specific **Customer Avatar** for your target segment in mind. Write as if you are speaking directly to them. Address their specific pain points, goals, and motivations.

### 1.2. Embody the Brand Voice

All copy must align with the defined **Brand Voice & Tone**. Refer to the `TEMPLATE_Brand-Voice-and-Tone.md` document to ensure your writing is consistent with the brand's personality.

### 1.3. Focus on Benefits, Not Just Features

Customers buy solutions to their problems, not just products. Always connect product features to the tangible benefits they provide for the customer.

*   **Feature:** What the product *is* or *does*.
*   **Benefit:** What the customer *gains* from that feature.

| Feature | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Waterproof fabric* | *e.g., Stay dry and comfortable, no matter the weather.* |

### 1.4. The "You" Rule

Write in the second person ("you," "your"). The focus should always be on the customer, not on the brand ("we," "our").

*   **Instead of:** "We created this new serum with powerful antioxidants."
*   **Try:** "You'll love how this new serum protects your skin with powerful antioxidants."

## Section 2: The Anatomy of an Email

### 2.1. The Subject Line

The most important part of the email. Its only job is to get the email opened. Refer to `TEMPLATE_Subject-Line-Formulas.md` for ideas.

### 2.2. The Preview Text

This is the short snippet of text that appears after the subject line in most email clients. It should support the subject line and add intrigue.

### 2.3. The Headline

Once the email is opened, the headline must grab the reader's attention and compel them to keep reading.

### 2.4. The Body Copy

This is where you deliver the main message. It should be easy to read, engaging, and persuasive.

*   **Opening:** Start with a strong hook that relates to the customer's problem or desire.
*   **Middle:** Present the solution (your product) and explain the benefits.
*   **Closing:** Summarize the offer and lead into the call to action.

### 2.5. The Call to Action (CTA)

The CTA should be clear, compelling, and action-oriented. Refer to `TEMPLATE_CTA-Best-Practices.md`.

## Section 3: Persuasion Techniques

### 3.1. Social Proof

People are influenced by the actions of others. Use social proof to build trust and credibility.

*   Customer reviews and testimonials
*   Star ratings
*   "Best-seller" or "Community favorite" labels
*   User-generated content (UGC)

### 3.2. Urgency & Scarcity

Encourage immediate action by creating a sense of urgency or scarcity.

*   **Urgency (Time-based):** "Offer ends tonight," "Last chance"
*   **Scarcity (Quantity-based):** "Limited stock," "Only 5 left"

### 3.3. Storytelling

Weave a narrative to make your message more memorable and emotionally resonant. Tell the story of a customer who was transformed by your product.

## Section 4: Formatting for Readability

People scan emails; they don't read them word-for-word. Make your copy easy to scan.

*   **Short Sentences & Paragraphs:** Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences.
*   **Use Bullet Points:** Break up long lists of features or benefits.
*   **Bold Key Phrases:** Emphasize important words and phrases.
*   **Use Subheadings:** Break up the text into logical sections.

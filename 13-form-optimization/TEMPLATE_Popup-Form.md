# Form Template: Pop-up Form

## 1. Description

## 5. Optimization Tips

*   **Timing is Everything:** Use exit-intent for new visitors to avoid disrupting their initial experience. For returning visitors, test scroll-based triggers.
*   **Keep It Simple:** A single field (email address) is often all you need for a pop-up. If you need more information, use a multi-step form.
*   **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure your pop-up is responsive and easy to use on a small screen. Remove any non-essential elements on mobile.
*   **Clear and Compelling Offer:** Your headline should clearly communicate the value proposition.
*   **Easy to Close:** Make the "close" button or "no, thanks" link easy to find and click. Hiding it will only frustrate users.
*   **Frequency Capping:** Don't show the same pop-up to a visitor who has already seen it or subscribed. Use cookies to control the frequency.

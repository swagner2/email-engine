# Form Template: Fly-out Form

---

## 1. Description

A fly-out form, also known as a slide-in, is a form that slides into the screen from the side, top, or bottom. It is less intrusive than a pop-up because it doesn't overlay the entire page.

## 3. Best Use Cases

*   **Blog Posts:** A fly-out that appears after the user has scrolled 75% of the way down the page, offering a content upgrade related to the post.
*   **Product Pages:** A fly-out that offers a discount on the specific product the user is viewing.
*   **Returning Visitors:** A subtle reminder to join the newsletter for a visitor who has been to your site multiple times but hasn't subscribed.

## 5. Optimization Tips

*   **Use a Teaser:** Consider using a small, clickable teaser that expands into the full fly-out form when clicked. This gives the user more control.
*   **Smart Timing:** Trigger the fly-out based on user engagement, such as scroll depth or time on page.
*   **Direction Matters:** Test which direction the fly-out comes from (e.g., bottom right, bottom left). The bottom right is the most common and often the most effective.
*   **Keep It Concise:** Since fly-outs are smaller than pop-ups, it's even more important to keep your copy short and to the point.
*   **Match the Context:** If the fly-out is on a product page, make the offer relevant to that product.

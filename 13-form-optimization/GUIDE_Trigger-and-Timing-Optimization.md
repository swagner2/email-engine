# Trigger and Timing Optimization Guide

---

## 1. The Importance of Timing

Showing a pop-up form at the wrong time is one of the most common and costly mistakes in email list growth. A poorly timed pop-up can be intrusive, annoying, and can even cause visitors to leave your site. On the other hand, a well-timed pop-up can feel helpful, relevant, and can significantly increase your conversion rate.

The goal is to find the sweet spot between being proactive enough to capture the visitor's attention and being patient enough to not disrupt their shopping experience.

## 2. Common Form Triggers

Here are the most common triggers you can use to control when your form appears:

### Time Delay

This is the simplest trigger. The form appears after a set amount of time (e.g., 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds).

*   **Pros:** Easy to set up.
*   **Cons:** Not based on user behavior, so it can feel random and intrusive.
*   **Best For:** General-purpose pop-ups on your homepage.

### Scroll Percentage

The form appears after the visitor has scrolled a certain percentage of the page (e.g., 50%, 75%).

*   **Pros:** Targets engaged visitors who are interested in your content.
*   **Cons:** May not be effective on short pages.
*   **Best For:** Blog posts, long-form landing pages, and returning visitors.

### Exit-Intent

The form appears when the visitor's cursor moves towards the top of the browser window, indicating they are about to leave your site.

*   **Pros:** A last-ditch effort to capture a visitor before they leave. Less intrusive than other triggers.
*   **Cons:** May not work as well on mobile devices.
*   **Best For:** First-time visitors and cart pages.

### Click-Based

The form appears when the visitor clicks on a specific button or link.

*   **Pros:** User-initiated, so it's not intrusive at all.
*   **Cons:** Requires the user to take an action, so it may have a lower view rate.
*   **Best For:** Teaser pop-ups and two-step opt-ins.

## 3. Recommended Trigger Strategies

Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, tailor your triggers to different types of visitors and pages.

| Visitor Type | Recommended Trigger | Why It Works |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First-Time Visitors** | Exit-Intent | Captures their information before they leave, without disrupting their initial browsing experience. |
| **Returning Visitors** | Scroll Percentage (50-75%) | They are already familiar with your brand, so you can be more proactive in asking for their email. |
| **Blog Readers** | Scroll Percentage (75%) | They are highly engaged with your content, so a well-timed pop-up with a relevant offer can be very effective. |
| **Cart Abandoners** | Exit-Intent | A last-chance offer to save the sale before they abandon their cart. |

## 4. A/B Testing Your Triggers

The only way to know for sure which triggers work best for your audience is to A/B test them. Here are some test ideas:

*   **Time Delay:** 10 seconds vs. 30 seconds
*   **Scroll Percentage:** 50% vs. 75%
*   **Exit-Intent vs. Scroll Percentage:** For returning visitors
*   **Time Delay vs. Exit-Intent:** For first-time visitors

When testing triggers, pay close attention to not only the form submission rate but also the impact on your site's bounce rate and average session duration.

## 5. Advanced Targeting

In addition to triggers, you can use advanced targeting rules to further refine who sees your forms.

*   **Device Targeting:** Show different forms on desktop vs. mobile.
*   **Geo-Targeting:** Target visitors from specific countries or regions.
*   **URL Targeting:** Show forms on specific pages or categories of your site.
*   **Cookie-Based Targeting:** Target visitors based on their past behavior on your site (e.g., have they purchased before? have they seen this form before?).

By combining triggers with advanced targeting, you can create a highly personalized and effective form strategy.

# Form Design Best Practices

---

## 1. Mobile-First Design

With over half of all web traffic coming from mobile devices, a mobile-first approach to form design is non-negotiable. Your forms must be easy to read, navigate, and complete on a small screen.

*   **Responsive Layout:** Ensure your form automatically adjusts to fit any screen size.
*   **Large, Legible Fonts:** Use a font size of at least 16px to ensure readability without zooming.
*   **Thumb-Friendly CTAs:** Make your call-to-action buttons large enough to be easily tapped with a thumb.
*   **Vertical Orientation:** On mobile, a single-column, vertical layout is almost always the best choice.
*   **Simplify:** Mobile users have even less patience for clutter than desktop users. Keep your mobile forms as simple and focused as possible. Remove any non-essential elements, including images.

## 2. Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy guides the user's eye through the form and helps them understand what is most important. A strong visual hierarchy makes the form easier to scan and complete.

*   **Headline:** The headline should be the most prominent element on the form. Use a large, bold font to make it stand out.
*   **Call to Action:** The CTA button should be the second most prominent element. Use a contrasting color to make it pop.
*   **Form Fields:** The form fields should be clearly defined but less prominent than the headline and CTA.
*   **White Space:** Use ample white space to reduce clutter and create a sense of calm and focus.

## 3. Form Fields

The number and type of form fields you include will have a significant impact on your conversion rate. The general rule is to only ask for the information you absolutely need.

*   **Minimize the Number of Fields:** Every additional field adds friction and reduces the likelihood of completion. For a standard pop-up, email address is often all you need.
*   **Use Clear Labels:** Place labels above the form fields so they are always visible.
*   **Use Input Masks:** For fields like phone numbers, use input masks to guide the user and prevent errors.
*   **Consider Multi-Step Forms:** If you need to ask for more information, consider using a multi-step form. This breaks the process down into smaller, more manageable steps and can increase conversion rates.

## 4. Call to Action (CTA)

The CTA is the most important interactive element on your form. It should be impossible to miss and compelling to click.

*   **Use a Contrasting Color:** The CTA button should be the most visually distinct element on the form.
*   **Write Action-Oriented Copy:** Use a clear, concise, and action-oriented verb (e.g., "Get My 10% Off," "Unlock My Offer").
*   **Make It Large and Clickable:** The button should be large enough to be easily clicked or tapped.

## 5. Use of Images

While images can make a form more visually appealing, they can also be a distraction. Klaviyo data suggests that forms without images sometimes perform better than forms with images.

*   **Test, Test, Test:** The only way to know for sure is to A/B test an image vs. no image.
*   **Use Relevant Images:** If you do use an image, make sure it is high-quality and relevant to your brand and offer.
*   **Avoid on Mobile:** On mobile, it's generally best to remove images to reduce clutter and improve loading times.

## 6. Branding

Your form should feel like a natural extension of your website. Use your brand's colors, fonts, and tone of voice to create a cohesive experience.

## 7. Accessibility

Ensure your form is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

*   **High-Contrast Colors:** Use a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text and interactive elements.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure the form can be fully navigated and completed using only a keyboard.
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Use proper HTML markup to ensure the form is compatible with screen readers.

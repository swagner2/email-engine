# Form Copywriting Best Practices

---

## 1. The Headline

The headline is the most important piece of copy on your form. It's the first thing visitors will read, and it needs to grab their attention and communicate the value proposition in a split second.

*   **Be Clear and Concise:** Your headline should be easy to understand at a glance.
*   **Focus on the Benefit:** What's in it for the user? Your headline should answer this question.
*   **Use Numbers:** Numbers are specific and attention-grabbing (e.g., "Get 15% Off," "Win a $500 Gift Card").
*   **Create Urgency or Scarcity (When Appropriate):** "Limited Time Offer," "Only 100 Available."
*   **A/B Test:** Continuously test different headlines to see what resonates with your audience.

### Headline Formulas

*   **The Direct Benefit:** "Get [Benefit]"
    *   *Example:* "Get 15% Off Your First Order"
*   **The Curiosity Hook:** "Unlock [Intriguing Offer]"
    *   *Example:* "Unlock a Surprise Offer"
*   **The Social Proof:** "Join [Number] of [Audience]"
    *   *Example:* "Join 10,000+ Happy Customers"
*   **The Question:** "Want [Benefit]?"
    *   *Example:* "Want Healthier Skin?"

## 2. The Body Copy

The body copy is your opportunity to expand on the headline and provide more details about the offer. It should be persuasive but also concise.

*   **Reinforce the Value Proposition:** Remind the user what they're getting in exchange for their information.
*   **Set Expectations:** What kind of emails will they receive? How often? Let them know.
*   **Use Bullet Points:** Bullet points are easy to scan and can be used to highlight key benefits.
*   **Keep It Short:** Most people won't read a long paragraph of text on a pop-up form.

## 3. The Call to Action (CTA)

The CTA is the final instruction to the user. It should be clear, compelling, and action-oriented.

*   **Use a Strong Verb:** Start your CTA with a verb that encourages action (e.g., "Get," "Unlock," "Join," "Shop").
*   **Make It Specific:** Instead of "Submit," try "Get My 10% Off."
*   **Create a Sense of Ownership:** Use first-person language (e.g., "Get My Offer" vs. "Get Your Offer").

### CTA Examples

| Instead of... | Try... |
| :--- | :--- |
| Submit | Get My 15% Off |
| Sign Up | Join the Club |
| Subscribe | Send Me the Tips |
| Continue | Unlock My Offer |

## 4. The Fine Print

While it may be tempting to hide the legal jargon, being transparent can actually build trust with your audience.

*   **Link to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Service:** This is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions.
*   **Include an Unsubscribe Statement:** Let users know they can opt out at any time.
*   **Explain How Their Data Will Be Used:** Be upfront about how you will use their information.

## 5. The Thank-You Message

The experience doesn't end when the user clicks "submit." The thank-you message is a crucial part of the process.

*   **Confirm Their Subscription:** Let them know they've successfully signed up.
*   **Deliver the Offer:** If you promised a discount code, provide it on the thank-you screen.
*   **Set Expectations:** Remind them what to expect next (e.g., "Check your inbox for your first email!").
*   **Include a Call to Action:** Encourage them to continue shopping or check out a specific product category.

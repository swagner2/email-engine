## 5. Optimization Tips

*   **Make It Stand Out:** Even though it's embedded, you still want your form to be noticeable. Use a contrasting background color or a border to make it stand out from the rest of the page.
*   **Use a Strong Headline:** Since it doesn't have the element of surprise, a strong headline is even more important for an embedded form.
*   **Place It Strategically:** Don't just stick it in the footer and forget about it. Think about other high-traffic pages where an embedded form would make sense.
*   **Combine with Other Form Types:** An embedded form should be part of a larger list growth strategy that also includes pop-ups or fly-outs.

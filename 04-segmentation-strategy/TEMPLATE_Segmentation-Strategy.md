## Section 1: Segmentation Philosophy

Our approach to segmentation is to move beyond one-size-fits-all marketing and deliver personalized experiences that resonate with individual customers. By grouping customers based on shared characteristics and behaviors, we can send more relevant messages, increase engagement, and drive more revenue.

**Our primary goals for segmentation are:**

*   **Increase Relevance:** Deliver the right message to the right person at the right time.
*   **Boost Engagement:** Improve open, click, and conversion rates.
*   **Enhance Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Nurture relationships and encourage repeat purchases.
*   **Reduce List Fatigue:** Avoid sending irrelevant emails that lead to unsubscribes.

## Section 2: Core Segmentation Models

We will build our segmentation strategy on a combination of models to create a comprehensive view of the customer base.

### 2.1. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis

RFM analysis is a behavioral segmentation model that scores customers based on three factors:

*   **Recency:** How recently did the customer make a purchase?
*   **Frequency:** How often do they make purchases?
*   **Monetary Value:** How much have they spent?

This model allows us to identify our best customers, those at risk of churning, and those who are new or occasional shoppers.

| RFM Segment | Description | Marketing Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Champions** | Bought recently, buy often, and spend the most. | Reward them, offer early access, ask for reviews. |
| **Loyal Customers** | Buy on a regular basis. | Offer loyalty perks, upsell opportunities, and new products. |
| **Potential Loyalists** | Recent customers with average frequency. | Nurture them with post-purchase follow-ups and incentives. |
| **New Customers** | Made their first purchase recently. | Welcome them, provide onboarding, and encourage a second purchase. |
| **At-Risk Customers** | Haven't purchased in a while. | Send re-engagement campaigns with a special offer. |
| **Lost Customers** | Haven't purchased in a long time. | Attempt a final win-back campaign before sunsetting. |

### 2.2. Customer Lifecycle Stages

This model segments customers based on where they are in their journey with the brand.

| Lifecycle Stage | Definition | Key Email Flows |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subscriber (Non-Buyer)** | Has subscribed to the email list but not yet purchased. | Welcome Series, Browse Abandonment |
| **First-Time Buyer** | Has made one purchase. | Post-Purchase Thank You, Review Request, Cross-Sell |
| **Repeat Customer** | Has made two or more purchases. | Loyalty Program, VIP Offers, New Product Announcements |
| **Lapsed Customer** | Has not purchased in a significant amount of time. | Win-back Series, Re-engagement Campaigns |

## Section 3: Key Segmentation Buckets

We will create segments based on the following categories. These can be combined to create highly targeted audiences.

### 3.1. Engagement-Based Segments

*   **Engaged Subscribers:** Opened or clicked an email in the last 30, 60, or 90 days.
*   **Unengaged Subscribers:** Have not opened or clicked an email in the last 120+ days (for list cleaning).

### 3.2. Purchase Behavior Segments

*   **High AOV (Average Order Value) Customers:** Customers who spend more than the average.
*   **Low AOV Customers:** Customers who spend less than the average.
*   **Discount Buyers:** Customers who only purchase with a coupon.
*   **Full-Price Buyers:** Customers who purchase at full price.
*   **Product Category Buyers:** Customers who have purchased from a specific category.

### 3.3. Website Behavior Segments

*   **Active on Site:** Customers who have visited the website recently.
*   **Viewed Product:** Customers who have viewed a specific product but not purchased.
*   **Added to Cart:** Customers who have added a specific product to their cart.

### 3.4. Profile-Based Segments

*   **VIP Customers:** A custom segment based on high spend, high frequency, or other loyalty metrics.
*   **Birthday/Anniversary:** Customers with an upcoming birthday or purchase anniversary.
*   **Location-Based:** Customers in a specific geographic area.

## Section 4: Implementation in Klaviyo

### 4.1. Segment Naming Convention

To keep our Klaviyo account organized, we will use a consistent naming convention for all segments:

`[Category] - [Specifics]`

*   *Example: `Engagement - 90 Day Engaged`*
*   *Example: `Purchase - High AOV Customers`*

### 4.2. Priority Segments to Build First

1.  **Engaged List (90 Days):** Our primary sending list for most campaigns.
2.  **VIP Customers:** For exclusive offers and recognition.
3.  **First-Time Buyers:** To target with a second-purchase campaign.
4.  **Potential Churn (At-Risk):** For re-engagement flows.
5.  **Non-Buyers:** To target with conversion-focused campaigns.

## Section 5: Strategy & Testing

### 5.1. Segment-Specific Campaigns

*   We will develop a content calendar that includes campaigns tailored to our key segments.
*   *Example: A new product launch campaign might be sent to VIPs first, then to the rest of the engaged list.*

### 5.2. A/B Testing

*   We will regularly A/B test different offers, messaging, and content for our key segments to optimize performance.
*   *Example: Test a 15% off vs. free shipping offer for the "At-Risk Customers" segment.*

# Zero-Party Data Collection Research

**Date:** December 6, 2025

## Definition and Core Concepts

### What is Zero-Party Data?

**Zero-party data** is data that a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand. It includes preference center data, purchase intentions, personal context, and how the individual wants the brand to recognize them.

### Customer-First Data (Klaviyo's Framework)

Klaviyo uses the term **Customer-First Data™** which encompasses:
- **Zero-party data:** Information someone gives you proactively (email, phone, birthdate, preferences)
- **First-party data:** Information observed by a brand about someone on their owned properties (product clicks, email link visits, website behavior)

### Key Distinction

- **Zero-party data:** Customer explicitly shares
- **First-party data:** Brand observes customer behavior
- **Third-party data:** Collected by entities without direct relationship to customer (being phased out)

---

## Why Zero-Party Data Matters

### Privacy-First Marketing
- Third-party cookies are being eliminated (Google, Apple privacy updates)
- Consumers demand more control over their data
- Zero-party data is consent-driven and privacy-compliant

### Superior Personalization
- More accurate than inferred data
- Customers tell you exactly what they want
- Eliminates guesswork in segmentation and targeting

### Competitive Advantage
- Acquisition costs are skyrocketing
- Owned marketing channels become more valuable
- Better retention through personalized experiences

## The "Flip the Funnel" Philosophy

Klaviyo advocates for **flipping the funnel** - making top-of-funnel investments a later focus and concentrating on creating meaningful experiences from the bottom up.

**Benefits:**
- Improve retention
- Feed top of funnel through word-of-mouth and referrals
- Use personalization to create better customer experiences
- Scale personalized experiences with Customer-First Data

## Types of Data and Their Value

### Behavioral Data (Most Useful)

Behavioral data tells a more useful story than demographic or psychographic data alone. It shows what customers actually do, not just who they are.

**Key Behavioral Data Points:**
- **Purchasing trends:** Referral source, purchase month, order frequency, AOV, LTV, first product bought
- **Website activity:** Product clicks, views to key pages (return policy, cancellation, account)
- **Email/SMS engagement:** Clicks by message type, engagement patterns
- **Customer service contacts:** Frequency and reasons for contact

**Why It's Valuable:**
- Predicts who is most likely to convert
- Eliminates guesswork in targeting
- Enables proactive communication
- Helps predict churn and other behaviors

### Psychographic and Demographic Data (Provides Context)

While behavioral data shows what customers do, psychographic and demographic data explains **who** they are and **why** they take certain actions.

**Key Data Points:**
- Location
- Age/birthday
- Gender
- Lifestyle preferences
- Values and interests
- Shopping motivations

**Why It's Valuable:**
- Personalizes messages based on customer preferences
- Provides context for behavior
- Enables lifestyle-based segmentation
- Supports gift-giving and seasonal campaigns

## Methods for Collecting Zero-Party Data

### 1. Sign-Up Forms

**What to Ask:**
- Email address (required)
- Phone number (for SMS)
- 1-3 simple questions about preferences, interests, or needs
- Birthday (for birthday campaigns)
- Product interests
- Shopping frequency

**Best Practices:**
- Don't create barriers to engagement
- Keep it to 1-3 questions maximum
- Ask questions that will inform personalization strategy
- Use multi-step forms to ask for more information without overwhelming

**Examples:**
- Travel backpack brand: "What's your next destination?"
- Eco-friendly store: "What's your biggest challenge in being eco-friendly?"
- Frequency preferences: "How often do you want to hear from us?"

### 2. Quizzes

**Purpose:**
- Help people find the right product
- Gather information about prospects
- Fuel personalized communication beyond initial recommendation

**What to Ask:**
- Product needs and preferences
- Use cases and contexts
- Pain points and challenges
- Lifestyle factors

**Examples:**
- Skincare brand: Skin type, primary concerns, current routine
- Game brand (Hunt A Killer): Playing alone, with friends, with family, or with a date
- Supplement brand: Health goals, dietary restrictions, current supplements

**Best Practices:**
- Make it engaging and fun
- Provide immediate value (product recommendation)

**Best Practices:**
- Send immediately after purchase

## How to Use Zero-Party Data in Klaviyo

### Profile Enrichment

All zero-party data should be stored as **custom properties** on Klaviyo profiles:
- Form submissions → Custom properties
- Quiz responses → Custom properties
- Survey answers → Custom properties
- Preference center updates → Custom properties

### Segmentation

Use custom properties to create highly targeted segments:
- Product interest segments
- Preference-based segments
- Lifecycle stage segments
- Behavioral + zero-party hybrid segments

### Dynamic Content

Use custom properties in emails for personalization:
- Product recommendations based on stated preferences
- Content based on interests
- Offers based on purchase intentions
- Messaging based on stated motivations

### Flow Triggers and Filters

Use zero-party data to:
- Trigger specific flows based on preferences
- Filter people out of flows that aren't relevant
- Create conditional splits in flows
- Personalize flow timing based on preferences

## Best Practices for Collecting Zero-Party Data

### 1. Value Exchange

Always provide value in exchange for data:

Be clear about:
- What data you're collecting
- How you'll use it

- Make each request feel relevant

### 4. Make It Easy

Reduce friction:
- Keep forms short
- Use checkboxes and dropdowns instead of open fields

### 6. Respect Preferences

Honor what customers tell you:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Asking for too much too soon** - Overwhelming customers with long forms
2. **Not using the data** - Collecting data without a plan for how to use it
3. **Asking without providing value** - No clear benefit for sharing information
4. **Making it hard to update** - Preferences should be easy to change
5. **Ignoring stated preferences** - Sending irrelevant content despite knowing preferences
6. **Not storing data properly** - Failing to sync with Klaviyo profiles
7. **Asking the same questions repeatedly** - Not checking what you already know
8. **Being creepy** - Using data in ways that feel invasive

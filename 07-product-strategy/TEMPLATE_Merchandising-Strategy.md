## Section 1: Identifying Key Products

### 1.1. Best-Sellers

These are your hero products. They have broad appeal and are proven to convert. They should be featured prominently in many of your email campaigns, especially to new subscribers.

*   **How to Identify:** Use Shopify analytics to find your top-selling products by revenue and units sold over the last 90 days.
*   **List Your Top 5-10 Best-Sellers:**

### 1.2. "Hidden Gems"

These are high-quality products that have great reviews but may not have the visibility of your best-sellers. Email is a perfect channel to introduce these products to a wider audience.

*   **How to Identify:** Look for products with high review scores but lower sales volume.

## Section 2: Increasing Average Order Value (AOV)

### 2.1. Commonly Bought Together (Cross-Sells)

These are products that naturally complement each other and are often purchased in the same transaction. This is the foundation of your cross-selling strategy.

*   **How to Identify:** Use Shopify's "Frequently Bought Together" data or a third-party app. You can also use your own product knowledge.
*   **Map out your Cross-Sell Opportunities:**

| If a Customer Buys This... | ...Then Recommend This: |
| :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Shampoo* | *e.g., Conditioner* |
| *e.g., Coffee Maker* | *e.g., Coffee Filters, Coffee Beans* |
| | |
| | |

### 2.2. Upsell Opportunities

An upsell encourages a customer to purchase a more premium version of a product or to add on features.

*   **How to Identify:** Look for products that have a "good, better, best" structure.
*   **Map out your Upsell Paths:**

| If a Customer is Viewing This... | ...Then Suggest This as an Upgrade: |
| :--- | :--- |
| *e.g., Standard Version* | *e.g., Premium Version* |
| *e.g., 1-Month Supply* | *e.g., 3-Month Supply (at a better value)* |
| | |

### 2.3. Bundles & Kits

Bundling products together is a great way to increase AOV and provide value to the customer.

*   **Types of Bundles:**
    *   **Starter Kit:** A bundle of products for a new customer.
    *   **Themed Bundle:** A bundle of products for a specific purpose (e.g., "The Ultimate Skincare Routine").
    *   **Value Bundle:** A larger quantity of a product at a discounted price.
*   **List 3-5 Potential Bundles:**
    1.  
    2.  
    3.

## Section 3: Implementation in Email

*   **Welcome Series:** Feature your best-sellers in the Welcome Series to introduce new subscribers to your top products.
*   **Post-Purchase Flow:** Use the "Commonly Bought Together" data to create a targeted cross-sell email.
*   **Browse Abandonment Flow:** If a customer views a product with an upsell opportunity, consider showing them the upgraded version in the browse abandonment email.
*   **Campaigns:** Create dedicated email campaigns to promote your bundles and kits.

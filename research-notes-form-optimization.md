# Form Optimization Research for Email List Growth

**Date:** December 6, 2025

## Core Form Optimization Principles

### The Value Exchange
Information requested on a sign-up form is a form of currency. Visitors want something of equal or greater value in return for giving their name, email address, or phone number.

### Key Philosophy
- Once you've paid for someone's attention (through ads, content, etc.), you need a way to communicate with them whenever you want
- Sign-up forms transform casual website visitors into engaged listeners and loyal customers
- Without a high-converting sign-up form, generating real revenue from owned marketing is challenging

## 13 Sign-Up Form Best Practices

### 1. Align Your Offer with Your Sign-Up Form Goal

**Offer Types to Consider:**
- Percentage off (10%, 15%, 20%)
- Dollar amount off ($5, $10, $20)
- Free gift with purchase
- Chance to win a contest or giveaway
- Free shipping
- PDF downloads and guidebooks
- Early access to products or content

**How to Choose:**

**Revenue-Focused:** Discounts convert the most high purchase-intent customers
- Klaviyo data shows email and SMS forms with coupons perform slightly better than those without (though not statistically significant)

**Margin-Focused:** Gated content, free gifts, or contests attract lower-intent visitors but preserve margins
- Free shipping often performs better for lower AOV products
- Percentage discounts work best for higher-ticket items

**Test Questions:**
1. Can we save more money or margin with a different offer?
2. Can we drive more or higher-quality opt-ins with a different offer?
3. Can we drive higher revenue with a different offer?

**Key Insight:** "Someone who's signing up for 10% off, they're probably going to purchase. Someone who's signing up for a giveaway, they want the chance to get free stuff, and they may or may not purchase."

### 2. Don't Show the Same Sign-Up Form to Every Visitor

**Segmentation Strategies:**
- First-time visitors vs. returning customers
- Blog readers vs. store browsers
- Different landing pages for different traffic sources (paid social, organic search, etc.)
- Exit intent vs. scroll-based triggers
- Abandoned cart visitors

**Advanced Features:**
- Schedule forms to appear only during specific timeframes
- Display forms based on real-time user behavior
- Use AI-powered forms display optimization to automatically test and optimize

**Warning:** Make sure specialized forms aren't "bumping into each other and causing a poor customer experience"

### 3. Emphasize the Value You're Offering in the Form Header

- Show the offer prominently
- Be upfront with what you're trying to sell
- Don't bury the value proposition
- Use bold, clear headlines

### 4. Set Clear Expectations

**What to Include:**
- What subscribers will receive (beyond the initial offer)
- How often they'll hear from you
- That they can unsubscribe at any time
- Links to terms of conditions and privacy policies
- Explanation of how their data will be used

**Example Fine Print:**
"We may use information collected about you on our site to suggest other products and offers. You can unsubscribe at any time."

### 5. Keep It Short and Sweet

**Klaviyo Data Findings:**
- Including an image has a slightly negative impact on submission rates (not statistically significant)
- Simplest, shortest forms are generally most successful
- For main pop-up: ask for email only, or email + phone on multi-step
- Even including "first name" can impact submission rates

**Why:** "If you get them to buy today, you're going to have their first name, anyway."

**Goal:** Make it as easy as possible for audience to share information

### 6. Don't Be Afraid to Ask for More Information

**Klaviyo Data:** More "complicated" forms (more components) actually correlate with better performance (though not statistically significant)

**Zero- and First-Party Data to Consider:**
- Birthday
- Product interests
- Shopping motivation
- Purchase frequency preferences
- Email/text preferences and frequency

**When It Makes Sense:**

**For Brands with Distinct Audiences:**
- Baby products vs. period products
- Men's vs. women's products
- Different product categories with different use cases

**If You Test It and It Works:**
- Some brands get the same opt-in rate with extra questions
- Must have a clear strategy for using the data
- "Unless we have a very clear path to how we're going to use that data, if it hurts our conversion rates, it's out the door"

### 7. Create Segments with Zero- and First-Party Data

**How It Works:**
- Information from forms gets pushed to Klaviyo profiles as custom properties
- Use for segmentation, dynamic content, and product recommendations

**Segmentation Opportunities:**
- Product interests
- Most important product aspects
- Communication frequency preferences
- Gender/demographic preferences

**Example Success:** Wilkinson Sword's gender-segmented welcome series yields 40% purchase rate (nearly 20x industry average)

### 8. Get the "Micro Yes" Before Asking for the Big One

**Multi-Step Form Strategy:**
- Page 1: Tease the offer with a question ("Would you like a discount?")
- User clicks "Yes" or "No" (no information required)
- Page 2: Reveal what they need to provide (email address)

**Why It Works:**
- Users feel they have more agency in the process
- Earns serious buy-in from users
- Works well for almost every brand tested

**Klaviyo Data on Multi-Step Forms:**

| Type | Median Submission Rate |
|------|------------------------|
| Email multi-step | 2.85% |
| Email single-step | 2.27% |
| SMS multi-step | 2.98% |
| SMS single-step | 2.58% |

(Not statistically significant, but shows positive trend)

### 9. Ask for SMS on a Multi-Step Form

**Strategy:**
- Page 1: Ask for email address
- Page 2: Ask for phone number

**Discount Escalation Option:**
- 10% for email
- 15% for email + SMS

**Alternative Approach:**
- Same offer for both
- Set clear expectations about SMS subscription
- About 50% of email sign-ups also sign up for SMS with this approach

**Consumer Interest:** 72% of consumers say brands should send text messages at least once a week (Klaviyo/Recharge research)

### 10. Don't End the Experience After Someone Clicks "Submit"

**Post-Submission Best Practices:**
- Send to a thank-you page outlining next steps
- Send confirmation email or text
- Reveal the discount code on final screen
- Include CTA to start shopping
- Address users who declined SMS but signed up for email

**Problem Solved:** Users who decline SMS on multi-step forms often don't realize the code was emailed to them, creating frustration

### 11. Use Single Opt-In for Email, Double Opt-In for SMS

**Email:**
- Single opt-in recommended
- "Cast the net wide and get users receiving content once they've entered the list"
- Clean out bad profiles on the back end rather than restricting entry
- Reward worth the risk of a few spam accounts

**SMS:**
- Double opt-in required due to stricter consent laws
- Includes traditional double opt-in and tap-to-text
- Tap-to-text counts as double opt-in because user initiates from their own phone

### 12. Optimize for Mobile

**Why It Matters:**
- More than half of all web traffic is mobile
- Mobile forms need to fit smaller screens without hiding fields
- Must be easy to read and interact with

**Mobile Best Practices:**
- Really simple design
- Flat-color backgrounds
- Big headers
- No lifestyle photography
- Copy that gets straight to the point
- Vertical orientation instead of horizontal

**Implementation:**
- Build separate forms for different devices
- Or use Klaviyo's all-in-one builder that automatically adjusts
- Add mobile-specific elements like tap-to-text buttons

**Tap-to-Text:**
- Allows SMS opt-in in just two taps
- Klaviyo data shows slight decline vs. manual phone entry (not statistically significant)
- Qualifies as double opt-in for SMS

### 13. Always Be Testing the Form Experience

**Elements to Test:**
- Copy
- Form design (placement of fields or CTA)
- Type of incentive (free gift vs. free shipping)
- Discount size
- CTA button language and placement
- Display triggers (scroll percentage vs. time on site)

**Testing Rule:** Change only one variable at a time

**Key Metrics:**
- Submission rate
- Conversion rate
- Revenue per recipient

## Form Types and Performance

### Klaviyo Data on Form Types

**Email Forms (by performance):**
1. Full-page forms (highest)
2. Pop-up forms
3. Fly-out forms
4. Embedded forms (lowest)

**SMS Forms (by performance):**
1. Embedded forms (highest)
2. Others

**Note:** None of these differences reached statistical significance, so testing is crucial

### Form Type Breakdown

**1. Full-Screen Forms**
- Display over entire browser window
- Most intrusive but highest performance
- User must interact to continue browsing
- Use sparingly to avoid poor UX

**2. Pop-Up Forms**
- Appear in middle of browser window
- Most commonly used type
- Best of both worlds: noticeable but not fully blocking
- Website still visible in background

**3. Fly-Out Forms**
- Slide in from edge of screen
- Less intrusive than pop-ups
- Still noticeable
- Allow continued browsing

**4. Embedded Forms**
- Appear statically on specific pages (footer, landing pages)
- Lowest performing for email
- Highest performing for SMS (likely because users are higher-intent)
- Good for visitors who come with intention to subscribe

## Benchmark Conversion Rates

**From Reddit/Industry Sources:**
- 7.5% is an exceptional rate (maybe 10% of stores achieve this)
- Depends on pop-up quality, customers, products, brand, and traffic quality
- Average rates typically 2-4%

---

## Additional Best Practices

### Copy & Messaging
- Clear, concise copy that tells subscribers exactly what they're signing up for
- Avoid generic "Sign up for news and releases" - doesn't work
- Get creative with value proposition

### Design Elements
- Use relevant images (though data shows slight negative impact)
- Stay on brand
- Make forms visually appealing
- Clear, prominent CTA buttons

### Timing & Triggers
- Exit-intent for first-time visitors
- Scroll triggers (50%, 75%) for returning visitors
- Time delays (immediate, 10 seconds, 30 seconds)
- Behavior-based triggers (abandoned cart, browse abandonment)

### Form Fields
- Limit to essentials for main forms
- Email only, or email + phone on multi-step
- Additional fields only if you have a clear use case
- Test impact of every additional field

## Key Metrics to Track

**Primary Metrics:**
- Form submission rate
- Conversion rate (from form to purchase)
- Revenue per recipient
- List growth rate

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Click-through rate on thank-you page CTA
- Welcome series performance by form type
- Unsubscribe rate by form type
- Quality of leads (purchase rate, AOV)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using same form for all visitors** - Segment by traffic source, behavior, device
2. **Asking for too much information** - Keep it simple unless you have a strategy
3. **Not testing** - Always test offers, copy, design, triggers
4. **Poor mobile experience** - Over half of traffic is mobile
5. **No clear value proposition** - Generic messaging doesn't convert
6. **Ending experience at submit** - Use thank-you pages and confirmation messages
7. **Double opt-in for email** - Restricts list growth unnecessarily
8. **Single opt-in for SMS** - Violates consent laws
9. **Not using multi-step forms** - Miss opportunity for higher conversion
10. **Intrusive timing** - Pop-ups too early or too frequently hurt UX
